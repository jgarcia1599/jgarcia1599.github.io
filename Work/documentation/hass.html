                    <h1>HASS: Home Alert Security System</h1>
                    <p>For my Final Project for the Internet of Things class titled "Network Everything", I created a Home Alert Security System (HASS) that alerted users whenever someone would approach their home. The HASS has a camera, a speaker and three IR distance measuring sensors. Whenever someone approaches the HASS, an alert message is emitted from the speaker that scares the users off by saying "Get away from me". I wanted the HASS to portray something resembling of a personality by making the "Get away from me" alert message a little amusing and not that scary. In addition, a tab opens up whenever the user approaches the HASS with the livestream of the camera, giving the owner a visual image of who or what is attempting against the safety of their home. It was developed using basic VanillaJS,HTML,CSS for the front-end and backend built on Node.JS that talks to an Arduino MKR 1010.</p>
