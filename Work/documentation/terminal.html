                    <h1>The Terminal</h1>
                    <p>This project is a technological performance that expands on one of the key concepts in Jeniffer Haley’s “The Nether” for the ITP course "Performing the Internet". After reading such intriguing piece, me and my project partner Vince Nguyen got fixated on the concept of a terminal that takes individuals from the real world to the digital world (The Nether). We saw such device as an extremely powerful pivot point that allows users to engage in a duality of their own identity. As such, we decided to recreate this concept by creating a terminal of our own using Tensorflow’s PoseNET library. Our terminal allows users to have a different faces on and play music with their hands whenever they look at our camera’s screen, thus allowing them to be an entirely different person in our rendition of a digital world. This website, coupled with our own performance sketch where a person transforms into Beethoven and plays music with his hands’ movement after living an entire life as a handless person, poses the question of whether living in a future (or present) that allows people to have both a real and digital identity is really worth compromising intimate interpersonal relationships?</p>
