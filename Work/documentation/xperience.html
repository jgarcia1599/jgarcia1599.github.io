                    <h1>Windows Xperience</h1>
                    <p>As a kid, I was always fascinated by computers. How could they achieve tasks that are so inherently complex in a matter of seconds and with seamlessly little effort? Now that I am studying Computer Science, I know that every single computer-based task takes hours of algorithm design and coding implementation that breaks down the difficulty for the end-users. As such, I wanted to convey the difficulty of a computer-based task as simple as submitting an assignment through gmail by taking full advantages of the features lended by Virtual Reality through the Unity Game Engine. In addition, I wanted to explore the idea of space, and how space is defined in a medium as nascent as Virtual Reality where the artists have a full range of control of the experience they want their audience to feel, see, listen, and fully engage in. As such, me and my partner Juhee decided to bring back a vintage piece of technology in Virtual Reality: the Windows XP computer. We want the users to feel enthralled by the space inside of a Windows XP computer, to enjoy the iconic green mountains laying against the beautiful blue sky. This scenery will be juxtaposed by the clock-ticking task of submitting an assignment via email. The user has to enter the computer, physically juggle through a bunch of documents that come from the folder icon to look for the assignment, enter google chrome, and submit the assignment. However, the former task is not as easy as expected as the internet connection is lost and our player must face the jumping dinosaur from Google Chrome. To submit the assignment, the user must kill the dinosaur with a giant cactus. This allows for the mailbox to appear, where the user can submit the assignment and win the game.</p>
